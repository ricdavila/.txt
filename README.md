.txt is a lightweight, modern, and intuitive text editor designed to simplify the writing process by eliminating the unnecessary complexities of contemporary software.

The *.txt files are a global and universal text format, accessible and compatible with any system. Using a *.txt-based editor ensures simplicity, longevity, and freedom from proprietary formats.

The interface of .txt is keyboard-oriented, meaning that changes to font size, margin width, or the application's theme are made through keyboard shortcuts.
